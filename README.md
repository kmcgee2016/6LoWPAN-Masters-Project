# 6LoWPAN-Masters-Project
This repository contains all relevant software developed for comparing 6LoWPAN forwarding approaches and a final 6LoWPAN:CoAP application 

The simulations were performed in NS3 and all modified network stack files can be seen in the "/Simulation-Development/lr-wpan" directory.
All relevant modifications will have a comment at the start, in the form of "//KMG". All other files found under "/Simulation-Development"
are application codes, used for the various tests.

The RIOT-OS modifications made in this project are mainly related to the CLI interface and subsequent UART output. Therefore the files 
included in this repository are only those related to the "RIOT-OS/RIOT/sys/shell/commands" directory, found in the RIOT-OS Git repository. The OpenThread modifications are also only related to CLI operations and are fully contained in the files; "cli.cpp" and "cli.hpp", which are modified versions of those found in the OpenThread git repository at the location "openthread/src/examples/cli".
The spectrum scanner application found in the "/Hardware-Development/Other Applications/updated-spectrum-scanner" folder is an updated
version of that found in the "RIOT-OS/applications/spectrum-scanner" directory. It has bee nmodified so that it compiles with the latest version of the RIOT-OS, as significant stack changes have been made since this application's development(No longer uses PIDs as a means of grabbing interfaces). 

The final application code contains a modified version of the nanocoap_server application found in the "RIOT-OS/RIOT/examples/nanocoap_server" directory of the RIOT-OS git repository. The radvd.conf file used in the border router E. Linux device is included in the "/Final-Application/Border-Router" directory. The actual border router used in this application is the one provided in the "RIOT-OS/RIOT/examples/gnrc_border_router" directory of the RIOT-OS Git repository. The ThingWorx files are merely for proof of their existance and are in .xml format. It must be noted however, that the majority of these elements were developed via a UI, except for the javascript found in several of the files{"Things_KMG_reportScripts","Things_KMG_CoapCommsThing"}.
